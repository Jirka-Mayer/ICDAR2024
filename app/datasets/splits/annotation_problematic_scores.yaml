#
# These are score IDs from the scanned dataset, that were problematic
# to annotate. These problems are usually related to the PDF encoding
# (inverted image colors, rotated images) or to the system alignment
# is not one-to-one with the MuseScore documents.
#
# These problems could be fixed, but we wanted to save time during
# annotation, so we decided to skip them instead, and annotate others.
# We believe there should NOT be a content-wise or an appearance-wise
# bias introduced here. These are really just minor technical issues.
#
# Scores here ARE PRESENT in the synthetic dataset, but were skipped
# during the creation of the scanned dataset.

# To see the score, simply go to:
